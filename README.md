# <img src="source/images/icon32.png" alt="ZenFeed Logo" width="32"/> ZenFeed - Hide Shorts & Reels

Block distracting content across Instagram, YouTube, and Facebook. ZenFeed removes reels, shorts, explore pages, stories, suggested posts, and other addictive feeds so you can use social media intentionally.

I created ZenFeed because I'd open Instagram to message/reply to a friend and lose hours to watching reels. Now you can check what matters without falling into the endless scroll.

## ✨ Current Features

##### ℹ️ Sources

This extension is mostly inspired by aymyo's
[antigram-extension](https://github.com/aymyo/antigram-extension), which has blocking features but only for instagram. My goal was to combine the major platforms into one extension.
